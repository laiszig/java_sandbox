### Functional Parallelism Model
The ForkJoinPool is designed for divide-and-conquer tasks, where a large problem is broken into smaller subproblems, solved independently in parallel, and then combined. 
Here's a simple example of implementing Functional Parallelism using a ForkJoinPool to sum an array of integers.
