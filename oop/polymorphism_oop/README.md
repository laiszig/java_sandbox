#### Simulate a payroll calculation where you have:

1. An employee (name, position) who can be either:
    - Hourly employee (hourly rate, hours worked), or 
    - Salaried employee (salary, percentage deduction).
- Both classes must have the method pay() that returns a double.

2. Create a report class with a report() method that should be able to report either type of employee.
